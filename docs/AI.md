## REQUIRED RULES

### Language and Communication

- **Language**: English only
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Docstrings

## Project Overview (INFORMATIONAL)

**Geoaddress** is a Python library for address geocoding and reverse geocoding. It provides a unified interface to multiple geocoding providers (Nominatim, Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.) using ProviderKit for provider management.

### Core Functionality

1. **Search addresses** with multiple geocoding providers:
   - Address geocoding (address → coordinates)
   - Reverse geocoding (coordinates → address)
   - Address validation and normalization
   - Get address by reference ID
   - Get address by OpenStreetMap ID

2. **Manage multiple providers** through ProviderKit:
   - Provider discovery and enumeration
   - Provider selection and fallback mechanisms
   - Configuration management per provider
   - Dependency validation (API keys, packages)

3. **Standardized address format**:
   - Consistent address field structure across all providers
   - Field descriptions for address components
   - Support for international addresses

### Supported Providers

**Free providers**: Nominatim, Photon  
**Paid/API key providers**: Google Maps, Mapbox, LocationIQ, OpenCage, Geocode Earth, Geoapify, Maps.co, HERE

---

## Architecture (REQUIRED)

- Provider-based architecture built on ProviderKit
- Each geocoding service is implemented as a provider inheriting from `GeoaddressProvider`
- `GeoaddressProvider` extends `ProviderBase` from ProviderKit
- Providers are organized in the `providers/` directory
- Common functionality is shared through the base `GeoaddressProvider` class
- Provider discovery and management is handled by ProviderKit

```

### Key Directories

- `src/geoaddress/providers/`: Address provider implementations
- `src/geoaddress/commands/`: Command infrastructure for CLI system
- `tests/`: All tests using pytest

---

## Command Execution (ABSOLUTE)

- **Always use**: `./service.py dev <command>` or `python dev.py <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py quality <command>` or `python quality.py <command>`
- Never execute commands directly without going through these entry points

---

## Code Standards (REQUIRED)

### Typing and Documentation

- All public functions and methods **must** have complete type hints
- Use **Google-style docstrings** for:
  - Public classes
  - Public methods
  - Public functions
- Document raised exceptions in docstrings where relevant

### Testing

- Use **pytest** exclusively
- All tests must live in the `tests/` directory
- New features and bug fixes require corresponding tests

### Linting and Formatting

- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use configured tools:
  - `ruff`
  - `mypy`
- Use the configured formatter:
  - `ruff format`

---

## Code Quality Principles (REQUIRED)

- **Simplicity first**: Write the simplest possible solution. Avoid complexity unless clearly necessary.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to the absolute minimum. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise. Always prefer standard library.
- **No over-engineering**: Do not add abstractions, patterns, or layers unless they solve a real problem or are clearly needed.
- **Comments**: Comments are minimal and only when they resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment what the code already states clearly. Do not add comments that reiterate obvious logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: One responsibility per module
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity

---

## Module Organization (REQUIRED)

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear public API via `__init__.py`
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Provider-based architecture: Keep providers in separate files

---

## ProviderKit Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `providerkit` is an installed package
- Always use standard Python imports:
  - `from providerkit import ProviderBase`
  - `from providerkit.helpers import get_providers, try_providers`
- Never manipulate import paths
- Never use file-based or relative imports to access `providerkit`
- For dynamic imports, use:
  - `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library

---

## Qualitybase Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `qualitybase` is an installed package (used via service.py)
- Always use standard Python imports from `qualitybase.services` when needed
- No path manipulation: Never manipulate `sys.path` or use file paths to import qualitybase modules
- Direct imports only: Use `from qualitybase.services import ...` or `import qualitybase.services ...`
- Standard library imports: Use `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library if needed for dynamic imports
- Works everywhere: Since qualitybase is installed in the virtual environment, imports work consistently across all projects

---

## Provider Development (REQUIRED)

### Creating Providers

Providers must inherit from `GeoaddressProvider`:

```python
from geoaddress.providers import GeoaddressProvider

class MyProvider(GeoaddressProvider):
    name = "my_provider"
    display_name = "My Provider"
    description = "Description of my provider"
    required_packages = ["requests"]
    config_keys = ["MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY"]
    config_defaults = {"MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY": None}
    config_required = ["MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY"]
    config_prefix = "MY_PROVIDER"
    services = ["search_addresses", "get_address_by_reference", "reverse_geocode", "get_address_by_osm"]
```

### Required Services

All providers must implement:
- `search_addresses(query: str, **kwargs)`: Search for addresses by query string
- `get_address_by_reference(reference: str, **kwargs)`: Get address by provider-specific reference ID
- `reverse_geocode(latitude: float, longitude: float, **kwargs)`: Convert coordinates to address
- `get_address_by_osm(osm_id: str, osm_type: str, **kwargs)`: Get address by OpenStreetMap ID (if supported)

### Address Format Standardization

- All providers must return addresses in the standardized format defined by `GEOADDRESS_FIELDS_DESCRIPTIONS`
- Map provider's native response format to standard geoaddress format
- Use `None` or empty strings for missing optional fields
- Never omit required fields
- Store coordinates as floats with appropriate precision

---

## Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

- `ENVFILE_PATH`
  - Path to `.env` file to load automatically
  - Relative to project root if not absolute
- `ENSURE_VIRTUALENV`
  - Set to `1` to automatically activate `.venv` if it exists
- Provider-specific variables:
  - Use provider-specific prefixes (e.g., `NOMINATIM_`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_`, `MAPBOX_`, etc.)
  - Never hardcode API keys in code

---

## Error Handling (REQUIRED)

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Do not swallow exceptions silently
- Document exceptions in docstrings where relevant
- Handle API rate limits and failures with proper retry logic when appropriate
- Support provider fallback mechanisms for resilience

---

## Configuration and Secrets (ABSOLUTE)

- Never hardcode:
  - API keys
  - Credentials
  - Tokens
  - Secrets
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Use provider-specific configuration prefixes
- Clearly document required configuration

---

## Versioning (REQUIRED)

- Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Update versions appropriately
- Clearly document breaking changes

---

## CLI System (INFORMATIONAL)

Geoaddress discovers commands from:

1. `commands/` directory
2. `.commands.json` configuration file

### Command Creation Rules (REQUIRED)

- Use `Command` class from `commands.base` **or**
- Define functions ending with `_command`
- Commands must:
  - Accept `args: list[str]`
  - Return `bool` (success / failure)

---

## Anti-Hallucination Clause (ABSOLUTE)

If a requested change is:
- Not supported by this document
- Not clearly aligned with the existing codebase
- Requiring assumptions or invention

You must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what is unclear or conflicting
3. Ask for clarification

Do not guess. Do not invent.
